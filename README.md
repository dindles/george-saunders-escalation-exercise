# The George Saunders Escalation Exercise

## Introduction

### The book

This project is based on "Appendix B – An escalation exercise" from George Saunders' _A Swim in a Pond in the Rain_, 2021.

The book resulted from Saunders' 20 years teaching a class on the Russian short story at Syracuse University.

The book comprises seven stories – from Chekhov, Turgenev, Tolstoy and Gogol – and related essays charmingly and insighfully written by Saunders.

The seven stories and associated essays are followed by three appendices, each describing an exercise that teaches a principle of good writing.

### The project

I read _A Swim in a Pond in the Rain_ in December 2022, shortly after I had begun to learn Python.

When I read Appendix B (an excerpt from which is reproduced below), it occurred to me that it was well-pitched as a beginner's programming project.

I had a lot of fun putting together the simple logic, and once I'd completed it I realised I wanted to share it.

That entailed an unanticipated diversion into HTML, CSS and Javascript, and this page is the modest result.

### An Escalation Exercise

Set a timer for, let's say, forty-five minutes.
Now write a 200-word story. BUT the trick is: you get to use only 50 words to do it.
You'll discover your own way of keeping track of the word count; one approach is to make a running list. Say, for example, that your first sentence turns out to be "A cow stood in the field."
You write, at the bottom of the page, for reference:

1. a
2. cow
3. stood
4. in
5. the
6. field

Now you "have" those 6 words to use going forward.
When you hit 50 words that's it: you have to start reusing words. (Let's allow plurals. So "cow" and "cows" count as the same word.)
The final product is to be <em>exactly</em> 200 words (not 199, not 201).
Ready? Go.
