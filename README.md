# The George Saunders Escalation Exercise

## Introduction

### The book

This project is based on "Appendix B – An escalation exercise" from George Saunders' _A Swim in a Pond in the Rain_, 2021.

The book resulted from Saunders' 20 years teaching a class on the Russian short story at Syracuse University.

The book comprises seven stories – from Chekhov, Turgenev, Tolstoy and Gogol – and related essays written by Saunders.

He asks us what it means to write a story that impels us to keep reading it, and he thinks about these stories deeply and with great charm.

The seven stories and associated essays are followed by three appendices, each describing an exercise that teaches a principle of good writing.

### The project

I read _A Swim in a Pond in the Rain_ in December 2022, shortly after I had begun to learn python.

When I read Appendix B (reproduced in full below), it occurred to me that it was well-pitched as a beginner's programming project.

I had a tremendous amount of fun doing it, learnt a great deal despite its modest scope, and once I'd completed it I realised I wanted to share it.

This page is the modest result. Along the way I learned basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript – none of which I ever imagined I would before the project took over.

#### An Escalation Exercise

##### Exercise

Set a timer for, let's say, forty-five minutes.
Now write a 200-word story. BUT the trick is: you get to use only 50 words to do it.
You'll discover your own way of keeping track of the word count; one approach is to make a running list. Say, for example, that your first sentence turns out to be "A cow stood in the field."
You write, at the bottom of the page, for reference:

1. a
2. cow
3. stood
4. in
5. the
6. field

Now you "have" those 6 words to use going forward.
When you hit 50 words that's it: you have to start reusing words. (Let's allow plurals. So "cow" and "cows" count as the same word.)
The final product is to be <em>exactly</em> 200 words (not 199, not 201).
Ready? Go.

##### Discussion

Most writers tend to write stories that are long on exposition but never ascend into the rising action (that is, they don't escalate). I've read entire student novels like this – pages and pages of brilliant exposition in which the tension never rises. I sometimes say that in the exposition we put a pot of water on the stove; getting the action to rise is making the water boil. (What we've been calling "meaningful action" is equal to the boiling water is equal to escalation.)
For reasons I don't understand, the stories produced using this exercise almost always have rising action. For certain students, they tend to be funnier and more entertianing and more dramatically shaped than those writers' "real" work.
If you like the piece you wrote – if it seems to have something your more seriously produced stories lack – you might pause here and ask why that is, exactly.  
Why does this exercise work? I'm not sure. The contraints have something to do with it (the 50-word limt and the exacting – 200, not 199, not 201 – word count). When a person is doing this exercise, her attention is on those contraints, which means she's approaching things differently than she normally would. The paaret of her mind that would usually be thinking about her themes or jpreserving her style or the piece's goal or her politics is being kept busy counting words. Which allows anotehr part of her mind to step forward, a less conscious, more playful part.  
When I assign this exercise in class, I announce beforehand that everyone will be reading their story aloud afterward. This intnsifies things. ("Depend upon it sir, when a man knows he is to be hanged in a fortnight, it concentrates his mind wonderfully.") This brings out a natural performative streak that just about evry writer I know has.  
When I was a student at Syracuse, Doug Unger, a little fed up with how clever and "literary" the stories we'd been writing were, announced, jsut before a break in workshop, that during the second half we were each going to have to <em>tell</em> a story on the spot.  
Talk about a nerve-filled break.  
But compared to the stories we'd been submitting, the stories we told that night were, without exception, livelier and more dramatic and more infused with who we really were, richer with our real charms, the way we actually were witty in the world.  
What is there to do with the little pieces that result from this exercise? They usually sound a little strange, Seussian. Once a student made a larger story out of several passes at this exercise; in each pass he used a different 50-word set, but he kept the same characters throughout the longer story he made out of those 200-word bits. Other students have used this exercise to generate a sort of starter piece, with good rising action, then relaxed the constraints and rewrote the story using as many "new" words as they wanted.  
The beauty of this exercise is that is shows us that we usually walk around with a certain idea of the writer we are in our head. When we sit down to write, that writer is the one we start channeling. In that instant, our brain fucntion changes. We're less open to what the story wants to do, to what the language generator inside us wants to do. We're working within the narrow range of how we think we should write. This exercise shuts down that way of thinking by keeping it busy with the practicalities of the exercise, which leaves the rest of the mind asking, "Well, what else have we got?" That is: "What other writers might be in here?"  
Maybe this exercise is a bit like dancing while drunk and then filming it. In playback, we might catch a glimpse of something we don't normally attempt, but that we like. And if we like it, we might want to do it on purpose, later.
