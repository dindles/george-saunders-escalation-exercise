# The George Saunders Escalation Exercise

## Introduction

### The book

This project is based on "Appendix B – An escalation exercise" from George Saunders' _A Swim in a Pond in the Rain_, 2021.

The book resulted from Saunders' 20 years teaching a class on the Russian short story at Syracuse University. 

The book comprises seven stories – from Chekhov, Turgenev, Tolstoy and Gogol – translated into English, and followed by essays written by Saunders. 

He asks what it means to write a story that impels us to keep reading it, and he thinks about these stories deeply and with great charm.

The seven stories and associated essays are followed by three appendices, each describing an exercise that teaches a principle of good writing. 

### The project

I read _A Swim in a Pond in the Rain_ in December, 2022, shortly after I had begun to learn python. 

When I read Appendix B (reproduced in full below), it occurred to me that it was well-pitched as a beginner's programming project. 

I had a tremendous amount of fun doing it, learnt a great deal despite its modest scope, and once I'd completed it I realised I wanted to share it.

This webapp is the result. Along the way I learned basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Flask – none of which I ever imagined I would before the project took over.
